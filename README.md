This repository contains a web application built with Next.js, Vercel, and MongoDB. In order for the backend and frontend to operate properly, please follow the instructions below.

## Getting Started
To run the Speed App, you need to have the backend server and frontend server up and running. Follow the steps below to set up and run the application.

Backend Server
Navigate to the backend directory:

```bash
cd speed-backend/src
```
Run the backend server by executing the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node server.js
```
This will start the backend server, allowing it to handle API requests and database operations.

Frontend Server
Navigate to the frontend directory:

```bash
cd speed-frontend
```
Install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```
Start the frontend development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
This will launch the frontend of the Speed App and make it accessible in your web browser.

## NOTE
Please make sure you have all the dependencies for the MERN stack installed in order for this web application to run smoothly. If you haven't already, you can install them by following the documentation for MongoDB, Node.js, and React.js.

Enjoy using the Speed App! If you encounter any issues or have questions, feel free to reach out to our support team.
